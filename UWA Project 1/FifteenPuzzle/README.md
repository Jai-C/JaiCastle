# Task to create the fifteen puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) Using java

This includes a random board generator and an option to start from a board that is inputted (this board is then checked to see if it is valid).

The program only allows valid moves and updates the screen when appropriate.

The program takes input from the mouse and uses this information to determine which tile the user intends to move.
