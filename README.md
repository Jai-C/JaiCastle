Jai Castle, The University of Western Australia

Some example code from university coursework (java files) at the University of Western Australia (as part of Software Engineering and Computer Science Degree).

The java files were written given an outline and then the main processing (code within the methods) was written.

The main course project source files have been uploaded under the folder "UWA Project 1", but note some information has not been included to comply with University Policy.
